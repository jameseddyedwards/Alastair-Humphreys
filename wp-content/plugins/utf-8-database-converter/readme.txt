Easily Converts the WordPress database from any type of character set to UTF-8 character set.

== Description ==

Since the release of WordPress 2.2 the character set has been set by default to UTF-8 and the users
that come from previously versions of WordPress, may have some problems with the old Latin1 character set
and the new default UTF-8 character set.<br>
This plugin has been designed and developed with the idea to do this complex task in a easy 1-click way,
so it will no require any type of advance knowledge about the topic to make use of this plugin.<br>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why i can't see the sub menu 'UTF-8 Database Converter'? =

If you are not the 'blog owner' or a user with level 10 (the maximum level), you cannot access this plugin.
Because this task is a little complex and exceeds the normal user daily tasks, i have decided to make only visible 
and accessibly for the user with level 10 which is normally the blog owner or the blog administrator.

= What are the System Recommendations or do i need something else? =

I make this plugin compatible with the next minimum requirements:<br>
* PHP >= 4.2<br>
* MySQL >= 4.1.2<br>
So it will no require anything different or anything special to work.

= Can i delete it after the task is done? =

Of course, once its make his job you no longer need use or have anymore this plugin in your plugin activated/stored list.
